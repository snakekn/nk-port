# Nadav's Portfolio

I created a portfolio detailing my pre-Masters work to help with several graduate applications. 

The website (hosted on [https://nadavk.netlify.app/](https://nadavk.netlify.app/)) uses:

1. Hugo as an open-source framework for static site development.
2. Netlify as a hosting platform.
3. Custom JS and CSS for a dynamic user interface.

I created this website in ~48 hours, and would be happy to build others for your team!
