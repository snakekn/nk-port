I recognize systems as intermingled. Religion interacts with environmental work, interacts with the words we choose to speak to one another, interacts with the messages I tell myself when I wake up. 

I leverage the tools (or superpowers) of [intentionality](https://medium.com/the-philosophers-stone/attention-and-intention-the-superpowers-of-the-human-mind-7a6837712afe), [radical honesty](https://www.radicalhonesty.com/) & [communication](https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/the-radical-communication-philosophy-i-try-to-live-by-353fe1e3a522), and [growth mindset](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/) to build meaningful interactions that paint an idealistic view of how we can live more harmoniously.

I'm dedicated to the [problem of climate change](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/) and believe our actions today will determine the ability of future societies and species to live with reduced [unchosen suffering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AqUYejDdmU).

### fun facts

1. I grew up in San Diego, CA.
2. I love sports that get me outdoors & using my brain: climbing, surfing, snowboarding.
3. Writer of the weekly published [Life of Pratice](https://lifeofpractice.substack.com), discussing opportunities to practice who we want to be rather than expecting ourselves to reach a goal and be happy.  
4. Traveled to over 20 countries. Only 1 kicked me out (but many deal with democracy-related protests, which may be part of why I chose to travel there).
5. I'm working on an educational series to connect communities with fungal-based empowerment tools to clean up toxic waste and Superfund sites.
6. I've journaled for 2,000 consecutive days, one page a day. I also built a text service ([journi](/projects/journi)) to help others practice introspection.
