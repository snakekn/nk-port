My goal in attending graduate school is to improve my design and ecosystem knowledge. By understanding environmental systems and the levers we have for change, I hope to design meaningful solutions allow humans to best  protect and interact with our landscapes. 

I'm currently researching the role of fungi in the soil and in carbon sequestration. Fungal species decompose biomass into nutrients, make nutrients bioavailable to plants, and can support networking interactions between plants to prepare them for external pressures (like heat or pest impacts).

Fungi are an important factor in developing high levels of [Soil Organic Matter (SOM)](https://franklin.cce.cornell.edu/resources/soil-organic-matter-fact-sheet). Higher SOM is linked to stronger agricultural yields and can reduce the impacts of drought and flood conditions. By supporting healthy soils and fungal populations, we can protect and nourish the plant populations and forests we are deeply interconnected with. High SOM levels also mean more carbon is sequestered within the soil, and is one of the highest capacity carbon stores accessible to us.

To learn more about fungi and our agricultural ecosystems, I spent 3.5 months on a small-scale regenerative farm (and intentional community) to learn to care for our plants, to inoculate and harvest mushrooms, and focus on fungal interactions. I learned and led the indoor growth facility, along with expanding our outdoor cultivation sites.

*healthy soils make healthy food. our small farm consistently donated food during harvest season to local food pantries.*

*i led inoculation and indoor growth of our oyster mushrooms, gaining skills on preparation , maintenance, and leadership over growing operations.*

*i took used growth substrates (straw) and created outdoor growing beds, which continued to produce mushrooms while improving the fungi's ability to thrive in the local environment.*

*we turned fresh wood stocks into biochar, a carbon-stable type of charcoal that supports plant growth and carbon sequestration.*

*our team researched the application of enhanced rock weathering media (mainly basalt) and it's impacts on carbon sequestration and plant growth in our corn and soybean fields.*
