I began this project on Nov. 20th when I changed my plans from applying to Stanford's [ESS-MS program](https://earthsystemscience.stanford.edu/academics-admissions/graduate-program) to Stanford's [MS Design](https://designprogram.stanford.edu/program-info/) program. 

After finding out most professors wouldn't take students in the MS terminal program, I chose the DESIGN-MS program because it would allow me to build on my design and hands-on engineering skills toward my topic of choice â€” climate change. 

My goal in the DESIGN-MS curriculum is to gain skills and work on nature-based design projects to promote: 
- sustainable thinking in the built environment, 
- the application of fungi or other nature-based tools in climate solutions, and
- community resilience through climate design.

I timeboxed myself to 10 hours to build this website, gather my projects and make sure it was all presentable. This way, I could get back to writing admissions essays and hope I'd make a compelling case to joining the program. ðŸ¤ž

This project uses Hugo to compile the pages and Netlify (with Github) to host the server. I wrote the Markdown files you're reading right now in Visual Studio Code, but I typically prefer [Typora](https://typora.io/) for writing as a low-fuss, low-distraction writing tool. I used these tools for two reasons: ease of writing, and demonstration of style.

I had to teach myself Hugo during the process, but the ease of writing made it worthwhile. I find myself frequently switching between a generative and an analytical mindset:
- Generative me can type out high-quality and high-quantity writing
- Analytical me can find and triage problems in complex systems with ease

I wanted to easily segment my work so generative me (typically between 8am-1pm and 6-10pm) could write while analytical me (mainly 12pm-7pm, with spurts randomly appearing) could code, and wouldn't have to task-switch too often.

Setting up Hugo took my analytical side time to learn, setup, and create an easy framework for content & assets. My generative side found the imagery by searching through my life-carbon-copy (aka Google Drive & Photos) and wrote up my activities & learnings. Markdown's syntax is focused on writing more than placing tags. I've been using it for my notes the last 5 years, so it was quick to build content with.

I love minimalism in design, and think a well-placed item in an empty field says much more than a room full of clutter. Especially with my time crunch, a minimalist approach felt right. 

Hugo uses partial layout files that you can easily customize to fit your flow. Black and white avoids the distraction of selecting the best color scheme, and the side panel reminds the reader of the goal: to review my (Nadav's) application to graduate studies in design. Only having needed elements helps screen readers parse relevant information for accessibility.

I chose to keep my captions in lowercase to keep them more informal and friendly, while my project introductions kept conventional sentence capitalization. I believe the process of design is an inherently non-traditional process, and we must be willing to think outside of convention to make new designs. 

I built a hover function that lets you view images related to a project before clicking through, ensuring that the minimalist design doesn't compromise the portfolio's ability to showcase work compared to other visually appealing, modern styles.

Total, I spent ~13 hours on this website. I'll review each page's usability & visibility, then head back to essay writing.

*i made edits in markdown and saw the changes made within milliseconds on my localhost.*

*with a bit of code, netlify makes it easy to host websites and keep them updated. i didn't spend any money on this project.*

*i used js & css to create an image carousel whenever you hovered over specific links on the main page. merging markdown with html concepts was fascinating to work with.*
