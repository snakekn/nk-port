Just as BLM protests were hitting their max participation in San Diego during 2020, San Diego's mayor pushed for funding to increase police presence in the county. 

When my friends and I wanted to tell our representatives we disagreed with the proposed budget, we found it difficult to even find who our councilmember was (by 2023, [the SD website](https://www.sandiego.gov/blog/find-your-council-district) \*just\* received an update to add an interactive map). So I created a GIS tool to:
- help San Diegans find their councilmember,
- prompt people to take action with pre-written material about the policing budget.

We didn't sway the council vote with the ~100 people that took action, but I had the chance to put my GIS & advocacy tools to use on an important cause. San Diego still spends [~$600M](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/about/budget) on policing each year, and [alternative policing strategies](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/neighborhood-policing-division) have a long way to go to provide the scope of support needed. This continues to be a pressing issue in our county.

### Takeaways
- Marketing makes and breaks the success of a launch. We should've reached out to local news stations and organizations to take action.
- Finding high impact levers in complex systems can lead you to using unexpected tools. Generalists can succeed by being quick to learn new skills.
