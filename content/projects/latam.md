I spent 3 weeks in Medellin, Colombia on the LATAM Impact Program, a short-lived program where college students around the world social entrepreneurship come together to better understand some of the problems faced in Colombia and work with similarly-minded locals to come up with pathways for change.

We worked out of the local innovation center and self-organized into teams. I joined the Public Sanitation team to tackle the waste management problem in Medellin.

Medellin is built around the valley of two hills, and communities built further up on the hill lack public infrastructure access. Waste gets piled up on the side of streets rather than shipped to the local landfill.

We spoke with people living in these uphill communities to determine how seriously locals perceived this as an issue, and what they felt could be changed. We pivoted a few times and came up with REMi, a gig economy service where homes could send a photo of their trash and get connected with a car or bike that could haul the trash down to the landfill.

### Takeaways
- Team cohesion is as important as a good product. Hold open communication about your goals and dynamic to prevent unspoken & continued strife, and spend personal time with your team to build rapport. 
- Use multiple methods of creating and validating ideas. If you've found the right approach, you'll be validated multiple times. Otherwise, you'll find key missing information.
- Pivoting an idea is expected. Creating prototypes to fail help speed up the learning process.

*professors from the d.school and from yale came to teach us about the design process and pitching social entrepreneurship ventures. we took the ideation process seriously (with lots of laughing involved too).*

*we discussed the core concepts of the problem of waste accumulation to find best ways to impact the outcome.*

*we built an mvp of an app and walked around communities to get feedback. the app showed what we imagined to potential users, and we pivoted several ideas because of their feedback.*

*our final idea, REMi, was to hire small trucks that could access the uphill communities while economically moving waste downhill.*
