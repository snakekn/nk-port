As roommates in college, my house would stop at Costco twice a month to get the cheapest home goods we could find. They weren't sustainable and they weren't all that cheap, and other houses without Costco memberships or space to hold that many home goods were paying more for less.

I wanted to find a way to support those living in Isla Vista with a better way to shop sustainably for their home goods. I spoke with households nearby (both college students and families) to learn what their current issues were and if they'd consider alternatives. 

People liked the idea of shopping more sustainably, but didn't have time to do the research. They didn't want to spend lots of money on poor quality products. And they didn't know what their options were.

I created EcoBox, a home sustainability box that would ship to people's homes. I created a matrix to audit products for their sustainability score, then ship those products to my door and dole out the products to each house. Homes would get the amount they needed at a wholesale price, without going out to shop or deal with the sustainability research.

I closed EcoBox once classes picked up my senior year. 

### Takeaways
- Testimonials from real experiences go a long way at converting new users.
- Quantitative surveys are prone to bias, but user behaviors are an okay method at gauging future behavior. It's important to craft previous data with rationale to build the full story.
- When you believe in an idea, it's on you to be the spokesperson and demonstrate it's potential. Nobody will market it for you until you show them it's safe to do so.
