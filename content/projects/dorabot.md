During ME 10 (ME Design), engineering students partnered with 5th graders to co-design and build a robot together. This class kept me in the engineering program â€” seeing how much fun it was to build with kids and ideate with them showed me that I wanted to be people-facing in my career.

We sat down and talked about the kind of robot we should make. One of the kids was a bit more shy, so I led-by-example that all ideas are good and fun, and these 3 boys were sharing ideas all over the place. We finally decided to make a dancing Dora the Explorer robot.

I wish I had photos of these kids. They were so adorable to work with. We co-designed robot pieces on Solidworks for laser etching on acrylic while I worked on the energy analysis and circuitry during my coursework. I'll never forget the awe on their faces when they saw the whole model come together. 

### Takeaways
- Designing the participation experience is just as important as designing the product. There's always a way to help others get more involved.
- Moving parts are likely to fail. Practice before execution, come with spares, and engineer safety factors into the design.
