As an engineering capstone project during COVID, I wanted to understand how we could reduce the environmental injustices from air pollution. This way, future respiratory diseases wouldn't be as damaging to underrepresented communities (like it is in San Diego, where asthma is 7x higher in 70% Hispanic & 40% under the poverty line Barrio Logan than it is in 82% White & 9% below the poverty line La Jolla).

I got a team together, won $3,000 in funding, and conducted analytical research on the worst sources of air pollution. We decided to focus on resuspended PM2.5 (particles under 2.5 micrometers large) from tire abrasion. Tires kick up small particles that stay suspended in the air and enter our lungs & the environment. Our design — a pressure-based filtration system near the car's wheelhouse — didn't win any awards, but we demonstrated the importance of solving the tire problem to support community health outcomes.

**Takeaways:**
- Testing is everything, so don't be worried about getting it right. You'll figure it out as it happens.
- Some well-timed back-of-the-envelope analysis can tell you when to cut an idea and when to push forward. It's always worth the 5 minutes it takes to see what's possible.
