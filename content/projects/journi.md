I've been journaling since I was in high school and believe we should all practice some form of introspection. Many people told me they tried & couldn't keep a journaling practice going. I wanted to understand why.

I learned through qualitative interviews that journaling was hard to keep as a habit. Even with accessible knowledge coming out about practicing strong habits (looking at you, [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)), people couldn't make the habit stick. People felt:
- Tired from trying to sit down and write more than a few words or sentences at a time.
- The struggle to remember to journal each day.
- Unsure of what to write about.

I decided that removing the barrier to entry was needed to give people the push to journal. 

I developed journi using low code tools (Airtable, Make, Bubble, Twilio) so people could journal through their texting app. journi would send you reminders and new prompts weekly, to help build the habit. I ran a month-long journal-athon that kept most users journaling each day, and we won the 1st place award at Venture For America's Pitch Competition in Philadelphia for concept, technology and leverage.

Not many people used it (I didn't market it outside my friends), but it was great to hear people talking about journi in their own conversations and how it impacted their introspective practice.

### Takeaways
- Momentum matters. Get a team or a motivation strategy in place.
- When you're not sure what to build next, get out in front of your audience and learn.
- You can learn anything given the time and an access to people. Find ways to get focused & in the right room.
- Users will find new ways of using your service. Be true to yourself while finding ways to keep the idea sustainable.
